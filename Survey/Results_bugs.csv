These bugs occur when a loop or array indexing is incorrect by one iteration or position. They're particularly common in loops that process arrays or lists. For example, a developer might write a loop that runs from 0 to array .length, causing it to access an index that doesn't exist. This can lead to unexpected behavior, array index out of bounds exceptions, or subtle logical errors";"Null pointer exceptions
These occur when a program attempts to use a reference variable that points to a null object. They're common in object-oriented programming languages like Java or C#. Null pointer exceptions often arise when developers forget to initialize variables, fail to handle null cases in methods, or make incorrect assumptions about the state of objects";;;;Wrong Input Type;We did not make a distinction for those bug patterns, but they are included in wrong input type, that is we consider the index is an incorrect input;Not present;Not something that can arise in Python, but indeed more frequent in C/C#.
